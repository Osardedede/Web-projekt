        The Anatidae are the biological family of water birds that includes
        ducks, geese, and swans. The family has a cosmopolitan distribution,
        occurring on all the world's continents except Antarctica. These birds
        are adapted for swimming, floating on the water surface, and in some
        cases diving in at least shallow water. The family contains around 174
        species in 43 genera. (The magpie goose is no longer considered to be
        part of the Anatidae and is now placed in its own family,
        Anseranatidae.) They are generally herbivorous, and are monogamous
        breeders. A number of species undertake annual migrations. A few species
        have been domesticated for agriculture, and many others are hunted for
        food and recreation. Five species have become extinct since 1600, and
        many more are threatened with extinction.
