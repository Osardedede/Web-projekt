        The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a hypercarnivorous bear whose native
        range lies largely within the Arctic Circle, encompassing the Arctic
        Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. It is the
        largest extant bear species, as well as the largest extant land
        carnivore. A boar (adult male) weighs around 350–700 kg (770–1,540
        lb), while a sow (adult female) is about half that size. Although it
        is the sister species of the brown bear,[8] it has evolved to occupy a
        narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for
        cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for
        hunting seals, which make up most of its diet. Although most polar
        bears are born on land, they spend most of their time on the sea ice.
        Their scientific name means "maritime bear" and derives from this fact.
        Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice,
        often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present. Because of
        their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as marine
        mammals. Because of expected habitat loss caused by climate change,
        the polar bear is classified as a vulnerable species. For decades,
        large-scale hunting raised international concern for the future of the
        species, but populations rebounded after controls and quotas began to
        take effect. For thousands of years, the polar bear has been a key
        figure in the material, spiritual, and cultural life of circumpolar
        peoples, and polar bears remain important in their cultures.
        Historically, the polar bear has also been known as the "white
        bear". It is sometimes referred to as the "nanook", based on the
        Inuit term nanuq.
