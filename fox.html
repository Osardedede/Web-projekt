        The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is the largest of the true foxes and one of
        the most widely distributed members of the order Carnivora, being
        present across the entire Northern Hemisphere including most of North
        America, Europe and Asia, plus parts of North Africa. It is listed as
        least concern by the IUCN. Its range has increased alongside human
        expansion, having been introduced to Australia, where it is considered
        harmful to native mammals and bird populations. Due to its presence in
        Australia, it is included on the list of the "world's 100 worst invasive
        species". The red fox originated from smaller-sized ancestors from
        Eurasia during the Middle Villafranchian period, and colonised North
        America shortly after the Wisconsin glaciation. Among the true foxes,
        the red fox represents a more progressive form in the direction of
        carnivory. Apart from its large size, the red fox is distinguished
        from other fox species by its ability to adapt quickly to new
        environments. Despite its name, the species often produces individuals
        with other colourings, including leucistic and melanistic
        individuals. Forty-five subspecies are currently recognised, which
        are divided into two categories: the large northern foxes and the small,
        basal southern grey desert foxes of Asia and North Africa. Red foxes
        are usually together in pairs or small groups consisting of families,
        such as a mated pair and their young, or a male with several females
        having kinship ties. The young of the mated pair remain with their
        parents to assist in caring for new kits. The species primarily feeds
        on small rodents, though it may also target rabbits, squirrels, game
        birds, reptiles, invertebrates and young ungulates. Fruit and
        vegetable matter is also eaten sometimes. Although the red fox tends
        to kill smaller predators, including other fox species, it is vulnerable
        to attack from larger predators, such as wolves, coyotes, golden
        jackals, large predatory birds such as golden eagles and Eurasian eagle
        owls, and medium- and large-sized felines. The species has a
        long history of association with humans, having been extensively hunted
        as a pest and furbearer for many centuries, as well as being represented
        in human folklore and mythology. Because of its widespread distribution
        and large population, the red fox is one of the most important
        furbearing animals harvested for the fur trade.: 229–230  Too small
        to pose a threat to humans, it has extensively benefited from the
        presence of human habitation, and has successfully colonised many
        suburban and urban areas. Domestication of the red fox is also underway
        in Russia, and has resulted in the domesticated red fox.
