            Deer or true deer are hoofed ruminant mammals forming the family
            Cervidae. The two main groups of deer are the Cervinae, including
            the muntjac, the elk (wapiti), the red deer, and the fallow deer;
            and the Capreolinae, including the reindeer (caribou), white-tailed
            deer, the roe deer, and the moose. Male deer of all species (except
            the Chinese water deer) as well as female reindeer, grow and shed
            new antlers each year. In this they differ from permanently horned
            antelope, which are part of a different family (Bovidae) within the
            same order of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla). The musk deer
            (Moschidae) of Asia and chevrotains (Tragulidae) of tropical African
            and Asian forests are separate families that are also in the
            ruminant clade Ruminantia; they are not especially closely related
            to Cervidae. Deer appear in art from Paleolithic cave paintings
            onwards, and they have played a role in mythology, religion, and
            literature throughout history, as well as in heraldry, such as red
            deer that appear in the coat of arms of Ã…land. Their economic
            importance includes the use of their meat as venison, their skins as
            soft, strong buckskin, and their antlers as handles for knives. Deer
            hunting has been a popular activity since at least the Middle Ages
            and remains a resource for many families today.
