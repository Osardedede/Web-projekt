            wildlife is at heart of our mission. We focus on protecting populations of
            some of the world’s most ecologically, economically, and culturally
            important species—the survival of which are threatened by poaching,
            illegal trade and habitat loss. We use the best science available to link
            on-the-ground work with high-level policy action to create lasting
            solutions that benefit wild animals as well as the people that live
            alongside them.

            <h2 class = "underline"> DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF TIGERS</h2>
            WWF aims to double the world’s wild tiger population
            by 2022 (TX2). We’re working with world leaders to take action, focusing
            conservation efforts in key sites, raising funds to permanently protect
            landscapes, and supporting community-based conservation. Saving tigers is
            about more than restoring a single species. As a large predator, tigers
            play an important role in maintaining a healthy ecosystem. Every time we
            protect a tiger, we protect around 25,000 acres of forest—forests that
            sustain wildlife and local communities and supply people around the world
            with clean air, water, food, and products. EMPOWER PEOPLE TO PROTECT
            WILDLIFE Over the last few decades, conservationists have come to
            understand just how central community involvement is to wildlife
            conservation success—and how important it is for communities to actively
            steward the natural resources around them to improve economic and social
            well-being. WWF’s community-based conservation work today reflects this
            fundamental reality. We work across a variety of communities and customize
            our work based on the specific needs and interests of a given place,
            taking into consideration each region’s particular set of conservation
            assets and challenges.

            <h2 class = "underline"> CLOSING ASIA'S IVORY MARKETS</h2>
            Illegal killing of elephants for ivory decimates global populations. Estimates indicate that
            each year poachers slaughter close to 20,000 elephants, mostly for their
            tusks. Fueling this rampant poaching is a steady consumer demand for
            ivory. Overall, we see demand increasing in East Asian and Southeast Asian
            markets, with the greatest demand in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and
            Thailand. WWF is working to shut down the illegal markets in Thailand, and
            helped end the legal ivory trade in China. By tackling these markets now
             as part of a pan-Asian approach, WWF aims to leverage China’s recent
             actions to ban the ivory trade to prevent further displacement of the
            current China ivory trade to nearby countries.
