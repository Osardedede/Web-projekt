        The goldfish (Carassius auratus) is a freshwater fish in the family
        Cyprinidae of order Cypriniformes. It is commonly kept as a pet in
        indoor aquariums, and is one of the most popular aquarium fish. Goldfish
        released into the wild have become an invasive pest in parts of North
        America. Native to East Asia, the goldfish is a relatively small
        member of the carp family (which also includes the Prussian carp and the
        crucian carp). It was first selectively bred for color in imperial China
        more than 1,000 years ago, and several distinct breeds have since been
        developed. Goldfish breeds vary greatly in size, body shape, fin
        configuration, and coloration (various combinations of white, yellow,
        orange, red, brown, and black are known).

        <h2>History</h2>

        Various species of carp (collectively known as Asian carp) have been
        bred and reared as food fish for thousands of years in East Asia. Some
        of these normally gray or silver species have a tendency to produce red,
        orange or yellow color mutations; this was first recorded in imperial
        China, during the Jin dynasty (266–420). During the Tang dynasty
        (AD 618–907), it was popular to raise carp in ornamental ponds and water
        gardens. A natural genetic mutation produced gold (actually yellowish
        orange) rather than silver coloration. People began to selectively breed
        the gold variety instead of the silver variety, keeping them in ponds or
        other bodies of water. On special occasions at which guests were
        expected, they would be moved to a much smaller container for
        display. By the Song dynasty (AD 960–1279), the selective domestic
        breeding of goldfish was firmly established. In 1162, the empress of
        the Song Dynasty ordered the construction of a pond to collect the red
        and gold variety. By this time, people outside the imperial family were
        forbidden to keep goldfish of the gold (yellow) variety, yellow being
        the imperial color. This is probably the reason why there are more
        orange goldfish than yellow goldfish, even though the latter are
        genetically easier to breed. The occurrence of other colors (apart
        from red and gold) was first recorded in 1276.[citation needed] During
        the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), goldfish also began to be raised
        indoors, which permitted selection for mutations that would not be
        able to survive in ponds. The first occurrence of fancy-tailed
        goldfish was recorded in the Ming Dynasty. In 1603, goldfish were
        introduced to Japan. In 1611, goldfish were introduced to Portugal
        and from there to other parts of Europe. During the 1620s, goldfish
        were highly regarded in southern Europe because of their metallic
        scales, and symbolized good luck and fortune. It became a tradition for
        married men to give their wives a goldfish on their first anniversary,
        as a symbol for the prosperous years to come. This tradition quickly
        died, as goldfish became more available, losing their status. Goldfish
        were first introduced to North America around 1850 and quickly became
        popular in the United States.
