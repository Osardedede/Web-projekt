            Gorillas are herbivorous, predominantly ground-dwelling great apes that
            inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa. The genus Gorilla is
            divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla,
            and either four or five subspecies. The DNA of gorillas is highly
            similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what is included,
            and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after
            chimpanzees and bonobos. Gorillas are the largest living primates,
            reaching heights between 1.25-1.8 metres, weights between 100–270 kg,
            and arm spans up to 2.6 metres, depending on species and sex. They tend
            to live in troops, with the leader being called a silverback. The
            Eastern gorilla is distinguished from the Western by darker fur colour
            and some other minor morphological differences. Gorillas tend to live
            35–40 years in the wild. Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or
            subtropical forest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although their range covers a
            small percentage of Sub-Saharan Africa, gorillas cover a wide range of
            elevations. The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane
            cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from 2,200
            to 4,300 metres (7,200 to 14,100 ft). Lowland gorillas live in dense
            forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level, with western
            lowland gorillas living in Central West African countries and eastern
            lowland gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its
            border with Rwanda. There are thought to be around 316,000 western
            gorillas in the wild, and 5,000 eastern gorillas. Both species are
            classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN. There are many threats
            to their survival, such as poaching, habitat destruction, and disease,
            which threaten the survival of the species. However, conservation
            efforts have been successful in some areas where they live.
